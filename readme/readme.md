# Readme files for my devices

| Config | Description | Readme |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| [esph_area_kitchen.yaml](/esph_area_kitchen.yaml)| IR integration with hob/stove, used for area specific sensors and to obtain data from local Xiaomi temperature sensors via BLE.| ~~[Readme](esph_area_kitchen.md)~~|
| [esph_bedroom.yaml](/esph_bedroom.yaml) | This ESP32 board connects via two separate GPO pins two pressure pads that are placed under my mattress for presence detection. This is incredibly useful to trigger automations at bed time or in the morning when getting up. |[Readme](esph_bedroom.md)|
| [esph_ground_water.yaml](/esph_ground_water) | ESP32 with an ultrasonic distance sensor fitted inside a plastic tube. The tube is fixed to my basement wall and monitors the depth of water down there. I place a table-tennis ball inside the plastic tube which floats as water rises. This provides us with a constant view of how bad the flooding is in the local area.|~~[Readme](esph_ground_water.md)~~|
| [esph_hot_tub_energy.yaml](/esph_hot_tub_energy.yaml) | I use a Sonoff POWR2 to monitor the energy my hot tub uses while also providing a remote power switch to turn the hot tub power on and off.|~~[Readme](esph_hot_tub_energy.md)~~|
| [esph_area_upstairs.yaml](/esph_area_upstairs.yaml) | I use this ESP32 board to read bluetooth data such as the temperature from a Xiaomi LYWSD02 clock. |~~[Readme](esph_area_upstairs.md)~~|
